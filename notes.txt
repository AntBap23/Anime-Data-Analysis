How to Pull Latest Changes from GitHub Main Branch
===============================================

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory:
   cd /Users/bapbap23/Desktop/Anime-Data-Analysis

2. Pull the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub:
   git pull origin main

Notes:
- Make sure you have committed or stashed any local changes before pulling to avoid conflicts.
- 'origin' is the default name for your remote repository. If your remote has a different name, replace 'origin' with that name.
